# Customer-segmentation-using-DBSCAN
# ABSTRACT
Customer segmentation is crucial for personalized marketing and strategic business decisions. This project explores the application of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) for effective customer segmentation. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters, making it ideal for identifying customer segments in complex and noisy datasets. The methodology involves preprocessing customer data to ensure relevant features are used for clustering. DBSCAN is then applied, which groups customers based on density, identifying core samples that are densely packed and separating them from noise or outliers. This approach is particularly effective in discovering clusters of varying shapes and sizes, which are common in real-world customer data. The results demonstrate that DBSCAN successfully identifies distinct customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences. The project concludes that DBSCAN provides a robust and flexible solution for customer segmentation, particularly in scenarios with complex data distributions.
# INTRODUCTION
Customer segmentation is a vital process in modern business strategy, enabling companies to categorize their customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This segmentation allows for more personalized marketing, improved customer service, and better resource allocation, ultimately driving higher customer satisfaction and profitability. Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, often fall short in handling real-world customer data, which may contain noise, outliers, and clusters of varying shapes and densities. To address these challenges, this project leverages the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Unlike K-means, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be predefined and can effectively manage noisy data by identifying and excluding outliers. This project focuses on applying DBSCAN to segment customers based on key attributes, aiming to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data. By doing so, businesses can develop more precise targeting strategies, enhance customer engagement, and optimize overall operational efficiency.
# CONCLUSION
In this project, we successfully applied the DBSCAN algorithm for customer segmentation. DBSCAN proved to be an effective clustering method for identifying groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics. Unlike other clustering methods, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be pre-specified, making it well-suited for exploring the intrinsic structure of the data. Based on the segmentation results, we recommend that businesses leverage these insights to enhance customer targeting, personalized marketing campaigns, and product offerings. By understanding the unique characteristics of each customer segment, companies can optimize their strategies to maximize customer satisfaction and business growth. We achieved an accuracy of 87%.
